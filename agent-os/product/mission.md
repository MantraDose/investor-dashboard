# Product Mission

## Pitch

**Mantra Dashboard** (MantraDose Investor Portal) is an investor dashboard that helps shareholders in MantraDose track company performance and their dividends by providing a single place to view revenue, product performance, marketing metrics, and dividend history—all scoped to their ownership.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Preferred shareholders:** Investors who hold equity and receive dividends based on company performance. They need transparency on revenue, payouts, and growth without relying on ad-hoc reports or spreadsheets.

- **Company leadership (optional audience):** Founders or finance may use the same portal to share a consistent view of performance with investors and reduce back-and-forth.

### User Personas

**Investor Alex** (e.g. 30–50)

- **Role:** Preferred shareholder in a CPG/supplement company (MantraDose).
- **Context:** Invested a fixed amount; receives periodic dividends tied to revenue. Cares about company health and personal return.
- **Pain Points:** No single place to see YTD payout, revenue trend, or how marketing is performing. Relies on emails or one-off updates.
- **Goals:** See current and historical dividends, understand revenue and product mix, and feel informed without asking the company repeatedly.

## The Problem

### Lack of investor-facing visibility

Shareholders often get performance and dividend information through scattered emails or manual reports. That makes it hard to see trends, compare year-over-year, or understand how marketing and product mix drive results. Time is wasted on “what’s my payout?” and “how did we do?” questions.

**Our Solution:** A dedicated investor portal with an overview, YTD and historical views, marketing metrics, and dividend history—so investors can self-serve and stay aligned with company performance.

## Differentiators

### Investor-centric, not internal BI

Unlike generic dashboards or internal BI tools, the portal is built for the investor experience: dividend highlight, ownership-scoped context, cap table visibility, and notification preferences. Investors get a clear, relevant view without learning internal systems.

### Single source of truth

Revenue, product performance, marketing (e.g. Omnisend, Facebook Ads), and dividends are presented in one place with consistent definitions. This reduces confusion and support burden and builds trust through transparency.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Overview:** At-a-glance YTD dividend, revenue, units sold, average order value, and total dividends, with sparklines and trends so investors see current performance quickly.

- **Product performance:** Table of products (e.g. Gummy, Bars, Capsules, Mini-Bar) with revenue share, units sold, revenue, AOV, and return rate so investors understand what’s driving results.

- **YTD performance:** YTD revenue, orders, and AOV with comparison to prior year; monthly revenue and order charts; and dividend history with status (paid / pending / scheduled) so investors track the year and their payouts.

### Collaboration Features

- **Marketing & Ads:** Email (Omnisend) and Facebook Ads metrics—subscribers, open/click rates, ad spend, ROAS, conversions—plus funnel and revenue-by-source views so investors see how marketing contributes to growth.

- **Historical data:** Multi-year revenue and dividend growth, AOV trend, and year-over-year comparison table so investors assess long-term performance and their total return (e.g. vs. investment date).

### Advanced Features

- **Settings & profile:** Account and investor profile (name, email, investment date, total invested, ownership %), investment summary cards, cap table view, and notification preferences (dividend notices, monthly reports, product launches) so investors manage their account and stay updated how they prefer.
